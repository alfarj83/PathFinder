ARCH-4070,Twisted Siblings:relationships Between Contemporary Painting And Digital Architecture,"Architecture and painting are two of the oldest forms of societal expression and have been historically linked in complex and dynamic ways. In the 20th century, the movements of Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism, Constructivism, Purism, Surrealism, and Dadaism consisted of dynamic dialogs between architecture and painting. These exchanges allowed each to have a profound and deep impact upon the other. By contrast, in early 21st century, there seems to be all but a mute relationship between the two. This course intends to help break that silence. This course will begin to bridge the divide by establishing new connections between the current preoccupations with materials, procedures, and affects that are emerging in both contemporary painting and architecture. Twisted Siblings seeks to explore and discover new relationships between the most cutting-edge digital technologies and how painting may influence the expressive capacities of these technologies. As contemporary painting and architecture seek to establish future directions, a new dialog and exchange of ideas should be emerging, to ensure a dynamic and radical future for both. The course will consist of a series of lectures, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to research a number of individual architects, painters, and writers who are producing work of related interest. Students will be responsible for completing a research project, which synthesizes the content of the course."

PHIL-4130,Philosophy Of Science,"How does science stimulate philosophical thinking and how has philosophy influenced science? This broad range of interaction is studied with special attention given to the concepts of theory, observation, and scientific method. Special attention is given to issues basic to psychology, in particular, reductionism, behaviorism, functionalism, and cognitivism."
PHIL-4140,Intermediate Logic,"This course is a continuation of PHIL 2140, covering basic metatheory of logic (including formal syntax and semantics, model theory, and soundness and completeness of proof systems), applications of logic (including automated theorem proving, deductive problem solving, and the axiomatization of various branches of mathematics), and alternative systems of logic (including sequent systems, diagrammatic logic, and modal logic)."
PHIL-4240,Ethics,"A critical examination of traditional and contemporary works in ethical theory by considering what these theories have to say about how people should live, what rights and obligations they have, what things are intrinsically valuable. Typically, this includes such topics as ethical and cultural relativism, egoism, freedom, and responsibility. Often the focus will be on contemporary issues such as war, abortion, equality, or punishment."
PHIL-4260,Philosophy Of Ai,"This course may be roughly divided into two general areas: philosophical problems in AI and philosophical issues that arise because of AI. An example from the first area is the Knower Paradox, a paradox in which an apparently desirable formalism for handling an agent's knowledge leads to inconsistency; an example from the second area is John Searle's attack on so-called ""Strong"" AI by way of their Chinese Room argument, wherein they claim that because a computer at bottom just manipulates symbols it cannot genuinely understand."
PHIL-4300,Environmental Philosophy,"While concepts such as quality of life, environment, nature, global ecology, and the like figure heavily in contemporary discussions, they are seldom integrated into an environmental philosophy. The course tries to achieve this integration by understanding some of the religious, mythic-poetic, and scientific dimensions of the man-nature matrix. Some specific environmental problems are examined in order to illustrate the system of values implied by various solutions."
PHIL-4310,Scientific Revolutions,What is progress in science? How has the concept of progress been influenced by science? Are there significant differences between scientific and technological revolutions? These questions are explored in order to shed light on the complex dynamics of academic and industrial research.
PHIL-4420,Computability And Logic,"A team-based, project-oriented, hands-on introduction to the great concepts and discoveries in logic and computability, including Turing Machines, first-order logic, the limitations of computing machines, Godel's incompleteness results, and so forth. A hands-on laboratory component is included."
PHIL-4440,Philosophy Of Mathematics,"This course reviews the fundamental epistemological, metaphysical, and logical challenges in the foundations of mathematics. Historical discussions of the paradoxes arising during the foundational crisis in mathematics, e.g., the inconsistency of class theory, the discovery of Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and the collapse of the Hilbert program set the stage for investigation into what mathematical entities are, how we can come to have reliable knowledge of them, and what choices we ought to make in the face of paradoxes or contradictions in our representations of mathematical truth."
PHIL-4450,Non-classical Logic,"This course provides an introduction to the philosophical and formal aspects of several families of non-classical logics that provide alternatives to classical (Russell-Frege) logic. Emphases will include philosophical objections to particular components of classical logic and how alternative formalizations of reasoning have emerged in order to accommodate these objections. In particular, topics to be covered will include logics of strict implication, intuitionistic logic, relevant logic, and fuzzy logic."
PHIL-4480,Metaphysics And Consciousness,"Daydreams about some tropical paradise ... the smell of freshly baked bread ... the flash of anger experienced when one person cuts another off ... the vision of an albino squirrel on the campus green ... Humans take all of these to involve activities or states of consciousness. But what is this consciousness with which they claim to be so intimately familiar? What are its metaphysical implications, and can people reconcile those implications with current scientific understanding of the world?"
PHIL-4500,Bioethics,"This course involves a philosophical analysis of some of the basic moral issues raised by recent and anticipated developments in the areas of biology and medicine. The general question ""What are moral problems, and how does one resolve them?"" is examined in the context of concrete cases involving issues such as abortion, euthanasia, organ transplants, experimentation on human patients, cloning, genetic engineering, and behavior control and modification."

This includes problem formulation, structured ideation, rapid prototyping, evaluation, functional modeling, and iteration. Studio III will also continue to draw on social science methods of ethnographic observation, background research, stakeholder analysis, and also a critical deconstruction of engineering design methods in a way that builds agility in ways more appropriate for those in DIS. Development of individual skills in design development, presentation, and portfolio building are also emphasized."
STSO-2100,Investigating Society,In this course students receive practical hands-on experience in conducting ethical and theoretically-informed research in the fields of STS and sustainability studies. Throughout the semester students practice a variety of social science research methods through a series of exercises.
STSO-2210,"Design, Culture, And Society","This course allows students to develop a critical understanding of the relationships between design, culture, and society. “Design” is defined broadly, touching on product/industrial design, urban design, and so-called alternative design approaches such as ecological and feminist design. The focus is on the role of design in contemporary culture with the goal of training students’ emerging appreciation of design as cultural practice on their professional work as engineers, architects, or business managers. This is a communication-intensive course."
STSO-2300,Environment And Society,"Society and the natural environment are crucially linked in a number of ways. Environmental problems such as pollution and natural resource depletion are not only problems for society, affecting the way people live their lives; they are also problems of society—the result of patterns of social organization and social practices. In this course, students will explore these society/environment interactions at various levels, from the local to the global, using the concepts and insights of environmental sociology. Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today."
STSO-2400,Public Health,The course aims to equip students with the skills necessary to critically analyze health policies and to advocate for equitable health practices. Students will engage with critical scholarship that will cover not only the foundational principles of global health but also the contemporary debates on public health ethics and policy.

STSO-2610,Design & Innovation Studio II,"DIS Studio II introduces students to general principles of user-experience design and industrial design as a set of approaches for attending to matters of aesthetics and form, usability, and meaning-making. It considers industrial designers as a community of practice. Assignments require students to synthesize social, technical, and formal concerns in the design of innovative objects. Students also gain competencies in CAD, real-time rendering, and project presentation."
STSO-2700,Law & Society,"There ought to be a law. . .""  Law shapes people's lives in countless ways; it is everywhere. Law permits, prohibits, enables, legitimizes, protects, and prosecutes. Law is more than the written word, the ""black letter law."" People make the law—judges, attorneys, police officers, legislators, defendants, and plaintiffs. This course will explore the law's social, political, cultural, and historical aspects. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine how social theorists conceptualize and explain the relationship between law and society. Students will be exposed to the theoretical frameworks that are used to examine how the law shapes society, and society shapes the law, and develop an understanding of the social processes that affect the legal system. The course will advance students' capacity to think critically and communicate effectively about themes, concepts, and arguments surrounding the law and learn what law is; where it comes from; who creates it; and what roles it plays in shaping society."
