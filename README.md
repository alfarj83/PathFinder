# PathFinder
Choosing the right professor or course can shape a student’s college experience and is a daunting task for many students. Pathfinder empowers RPI students to explore courses and professors in one place, compare ratings, and receive recommendations. We are here so students can make smarter academic choices with confidence. Pathfinder/Waypoint is a platform designed to help RPI students make informed academic decisions by providing a unified tool to search for professors and courses. Unlike existing resources (Quacs, RMP, etc.), Pathfinder/Waypoint consolidates information by displaying all the courses a professor teaches, all professors that teach a particular course, and the ratings and reviews associated with them. The platform aims to improve transparency, reduce decision-making stress, and enhance students’ ability to plan their academic journey. Developed using React Native/Expo.
